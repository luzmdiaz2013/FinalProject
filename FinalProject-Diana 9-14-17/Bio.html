				<h2>“At its core, our home is where we launch our lives from on a daily basis. Housing is therefore an important area of study and intervention as it carries vital health and social implications. For me, housing is the focus of my research, business and passion.”</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
				Diana Hernández, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Sociomedical Sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health and a JPB Environmental Health Fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health. A sociologist by training, her scholarly interests include the social determinants of health and the impact of policy and structural interventions on health and socioeconomic well-being of vulnerable populations. Her research examines the intersections between the built environment (housing and neighborhoods), poverty and health with a particular emphasis on energy insecurity. Her cutting-edge work has been published in leading academic journals including the American Journal of Public Health, Energy Policy and the Social Science and Medicine, among others.<br>
				<br>
				Drawing largely on qualitative and mixed-methods, she has worked on a variety of research projects pertaining to household and building-level interventions intended to improve housing conditions, with household energy as a central facet of inquiry. Dr. Hernández is currently a Principal and Co-Investigator on several projects related to structural interventions in low-income housing (energy efficiency upgrades, cleaner burning fuel source conversions, capital improvements in public housing and post-Sandy resilience among public housing residents) or otherwise related to alleviating the consequences of poverty on health (attrition study of the Nurse Family Partnership Program and qualitative evaluation of the Medical Legal Partnership model). Her work is currently funded by the NIH (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences), Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, the Fund for Public Health- NY, the Center for Environmental Health in Northern Manhattan and the Columbia University Provost office.<br>
				<br>
				Dr. Hernández completed her doctoral training in Sociology at Cornell University (2010), her undergraduate degree at Hunter College- City University of New York (2002) and is a product of the New York City public school system. Beyond research, she actively engages in a variety of translational activities through consulting, board service and social entrepreneurship in real estate in her native South Bronx neighborhood.
